[deep_gnss](https://github.com/Stanford-NavLab/deep_gnss), developed by [Stanford-NavLab](https://github.com/Stanford-NavLab), is one of the state-of-the-art data-driven approaches to positioning with Android raw GNSS measurements, based on the set transformer architecture. It serves as the benchmark for evaluating our method, [PrNet](https://github.com/Aaron-WengXu/GNSS-ND).

Slight modifications are made for the evaluation:
* We calculate the predicted positioning results and ground truth locations in the format of latitude, longitude, and height, and write them into files (see deep_gnss/py_scripts/Corrected_Position_set_transformer.csv and deep_gnss/py_scripts/GT_set_transformer.csv). We comment the codes for computing the WLS baseline positioning results (see codes in deep_gnss/py_scripts/eval_android.py).
* The training data are put under "train/Route1" or "train/Route2" (see codes in deep_gnss/config/train_android_conf.yaml).
* The testing data are put under "var/Route1" or "var/Route2" (see codes in deep_gnss/py_scripts/eval_android.py).
* We add the MATLAB codes to plot the positioning results of [deep_gnss](https://github.com/Stanford-NavLab/deep_gnss) and ground truth (see codes in deep_gnss/results_plotting).
* The weights trained by us are stored under deep_gnss/weights/Route1 or Route2.

Code repository accompanying our work on 'Improving GNSS Positioning using Neural Network-based Corrections'. In this paper, we present a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for position estimation using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. This work was presented virtually at ION GNSS+ 2021 conference. The presentation can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/_ZeEkEPwtAw) and our slides can be viewed [here](https://stanford.box.com/s/dj2eg3v886u408s234p92r52nok8twst)

## Installation Instructions
This code was developed in a `conda` environment running on CentOS 7.9.2009 in Sherlock, Stanford University's HPC. 

To create the `conda` environment, use `conda env create -f environment.yml`


## Code Overview
### Directory Structure
```

|  config
|  data
|  py_scripts
|  src
   |  correction_network
   |  gnss_lib
   |  totalrecall
```
### Description
Our code is divided into two main parts: `src` and `py-scripts`. `src` contains the core functionality that our project is built on while `py-scripts` contains  standalone `python` scripts for generating simulated data and training and evaluating the neural network. `config` contains `.yml` files to set hyper-parameters for the corresponding scripts and can be modified depending on your requirements. `data` contains example data files that our code is designed to work with.

Within `src`, the `correction_network` module defines the PyTorch DataLoaders and Network models; `gnss_lib` contains code that is used to simulate/find expected GNSS measurements; `totalrecall` defines functions and code used to simulate measurements based on a pre-determined 2D NED trajectory.

## Using our code
To run the `train_*.py` scripts, run the command `python train_*.py prefix="name_of_your_experiment_here"`. 

To run the data simulation code, run the command `python data_gen.py`.

Weights for trained networks can be found [here](https://stanford.box.com/s/pai1cqayccwumfa0289388e8y662p772)

We also used the `EphemerisManager` from Jonathan Mitchell's analysis of the Android Raw GNSS Measurements Dataset ([link to file]((https://github.com/johnsonmitchelld/gnss-analysis/blob/main/gnssutils/ephemeris_manager.py)))

Our coordinate analysis code is based on CommaAI's Laika [repository](https://github.com/commaai/laika)
